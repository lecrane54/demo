There was a gross woman named Rebecca who was sunbathing all naked and she was fat. Douglas walked up to her and said, \"I need to poop\". \"Okay, Rebecca replied, \"I like poop\". Douglas squatted down over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. The poop sat there on Rebecca's boobs, looking like a weiner." },
